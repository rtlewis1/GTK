Descriptions of the PUNK-Theme range from "easy to see," "slightly disturbed," "funky," "somehow elegant," "unhinged," "fun," "outrageous," to just "wow." They are probably all very correct statements.

This theme set showcases four Material Design color variations which exactly match their icon-theme counterparts. PUNK-Theme has been crafted to transform GTK, xfwm4, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon desktop environments.

Choose from any of the 4 individual desktop-theme files to download.

Manual Installation Is Easy:

For themes: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use GNOME Tweaks, Dconf Editor, or an equivalent 'Look & Feel'/configuration app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.


Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
