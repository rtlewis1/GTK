Material-STONES Desktop is a GTK, xfwm4, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon light-mode theme.

The Material-STONES theme is based on Material Design standards, and aims to bring a bright, colorful, and elegant experience to your desktop. Users will find their non-intrusive, monthly color just where they need it.


Manual Installation Is Easy:

For themes: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use GNOME Tweaks, Dconf Editor, or an equivalent 'Look & Feel'/configuration app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

For icons: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 2) Use GNOME Tweaks, Dconf Editor, or an equivalent 'Look & Feel'/configuration app to enable it for your desktop.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
