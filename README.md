ChromeOs-Dark is on GTK-Linux, with four fabulous Material Design flavors. More flavors cycle through all the time, so there is often even more to choose from. ChromeOs-Dark is the highly acclaimed - GTK, xfwm4, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon- Dark Mode theme grounded on Material Design standards; and aims to bring a warm, colorful, and elegant experience to your desktop.

The new rankings are still coming in for 2022, and ChromeOs-Dark now enjoys the #3 spot in the GTK Linux world - according to top Linux/GTK site: ubuntupit. In their words: "It has already gained popularity and become one of the most used mate OS themes... It has gone through extreme testing to ensure a vibrant, colorful, and elegant experience... the theme is decorated with grid-based layouts, responsive animations, transitions, depth effects, lighting, and shadow.... just like other Google Apps like Docs, drive, sheets, this theme is also inspired by Google’s Material design." Thanks again faithful users! https://www.ubuntupit.com/best-mate-themes-for-linux/

Choose from the four official-based hues of: ChromeOS-Dark-Marsala, ChromeOS-Dark-Oceanic, ChromeOS-Dark-Slate, and ChromeOS-Dark-UltraViolet. All four flavors are also available in 'Darker' modes.

Over the past few years, Google has been moving towards a unified user experience with its Material Design interface. It started with Android, and we’ve seen many Google Apps—like Drive, Docs, and Sheets—get this clean, modern makeover. Material Design makes better use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding and depth effects, such as, lighting and shadows. 


Manual Installation Is Easy:

1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use GNOME Tweaks, Dconf Editor, or an equivalent 'Look & Feel'/configuration app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
