A GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon- Dark Mode Theme - Based on the Official Color Palette Created by Ethan Schoonover.

At last, a Solarized desktop theme is available with general appeal. Introducing Material Solarized. This Solarized Material desktop scheme adheres to both Material-Design standards as well as those put forth by the official Solarized Color Palette. The fruits of this combination are a real bonus for those who need the scheme because they have to use their computers for hours - but still wish it to look elegant during those long periods.

Solarized-Dark-Mode - as originally created by Ethan Schoonover - is the highly valued color scheme for code editors and terminal emulators. Material-Solerized GTK dark-mode-scheme strictly adheres to Ethan Schoonover's original color scheme, which has been published for many major applications, with some including the scheme pre-installed. Coders and GUI users, alike, know that - once you try Solarized-Dark-Mode - it is hard to go back to anything else.

In His Own Words:

"Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. I designed this colorscheme with both precise CIELAB lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions." https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/

Over time, every element of this well-embraced theme package has been re-built from the ground up - an ongoing morphing process starting with the 1.4 version - to address any issues which may arise over the lifetime of the theme. Accordingly, the minor issues which have come up, have likewise been wholly resolved within the Material format - a particularly challenging scheme to keep bug-free. We are glad to hear Material-Solarized has been performing well on most systems sense its inception. Thank, again, secuvim - "https://github.com/secuvim" - for providing needed, early insight into some of those issues, along with additional package support. Thanks, as well, to Rikard Jungman (I rjungman), for your talent, hard work, and dedication to our cause!

Manual Installation Is Easy:

For themes: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use GNOME Tweaks, Dconf Editor, or an equivalent 'Look & Feel'/configuration app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

When installing the Geany text editor theme, put the unzipped file in your home directory at: ~/.config/geany/colorschemes (create the 'colorschemes' directory, to mimic previous directions, if it doesn't yet exist )

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
