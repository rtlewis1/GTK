Ranked again vis the "18 Best GTK Themes for Ubuntu and other Linux Distributions, Material-Black-Frost is a flat, dark-mode theme - based on the popular Nord-Frost-Dark Color Palette - for GTK, xfwm4, GNOME, and Cinnamon desktop environments (https://itsfoss.com/best-gtk-themes/). Material-Black-Frost also has three varieties of matching Icons and Folders.

The Nord developers describe the scheme as consisting of "an arctic, north-bluish color palette, created for the clean and uncluttered design pattern to achieve a optimal focus and readability for code syntax highlighting and UI components." In total, Nord is made up of sixteen, prudently crafted, "dimmed pastel colors for a eye-comfortable, but yet colorful ambiance." (nordtheme.com)

Special thanks to Sven Greb and the Nord team at: https://www.nordtheme.com/community#content, for initially advancing Nord, and for critical inspiration.

Both the Suru++ and the Numix icons and folders have been carefully crafted to match the Nord-Black-Frost desktop scheme, but they can surely compliment other desktop themes that sport matching color hues.
