joy! is a new GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell and Cinnamon light-mode theme which showcases a color scheme that is highly readable, colorful, and fun. The theme represents a careful crafting of modernized Numix elements, which have been structurally modified to have an out front look and lots of rounded corners - all aiming to bring a clean, colorful, and festive experience to your desktop.


Tremendous thanks to the Numix team for inspiration, expertise and contributions at: "https://github.com/numixproject/". It is always a pleasure to be a part of any work you have advanced.


Manual Installation Is Easy:

1) Extract the ".tar" or ".zip" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use GNOME Tweaks, Dconf Editor, or an equivalent 'Look & Feel'/configuration app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
