Numix-BLACK-Colors is a GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell and Cinnamon dark-mode theme which showcases a color scheme that is highly readable and attractive. The theme represents a careful crafting of modernized Numix elements, which have been structurally modified to have a flatter look and lots of rounded corners - all aiming to bring a warm, colorful, and elegant experience to your desktop.

Black-on-black-on-black with one additional color just where you need it, Numix-BLACK-Colors yields the perfect dark-mode experience.

Choose from Gold, Grape, Ice, Olive, Pomegranate, and Steel.


This is the matching desktop theme.

Manual Installation Is Easy:

1) Extract the ".tar" or ".zip" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use GNOME Tweaks, Dconf Editor, or an equivalent 'Look & Feel'/configuration app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
