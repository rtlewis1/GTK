Valyrian is a flat, dark-mode theme with transparent elements, and blue steel hues. This new theme accommodates GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, GNOME-Shell, and Cinnamon desktop environments. 

NOW, TWO COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM: COLD-STEEL & MOLTEN-STEEL

Valyrian is grounded on the Arc theme, ranked as the most popular Linux desktop theme for the past several years, according to major sources: (Best 12 GNOME Themes of 2022) https://linuxhint.com/best-gnome-themes/; (Top 15 Gnome Themes) https://www.ubuntupit.com/top-15-best-gnome-shell-themes-gnome-desktop; (Best GNOME Themes For Your Ubuntu Desktop in 2022) https://www.debugpoint.com/gnome-themes-2022/. For this reason, the developers have taken mindful care to keep every element in line with what Arc fans would appreciate. The result, we believe, delivers maximum comfort and readability to users; while simultaneously looking robust and elegant.

Manual Installation Is Easy:

For themes: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use GNOME Tweaks, Dconf Editor, or an equivalent 'Look & Feel'/configuration app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.


Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
