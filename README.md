Solarized-DarkArc-COLORPACK is a GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell - Dark Mode Theme - based on the Official Color Pallet created by Ethan Schoonover (https://itsfoss.com/best-gtk-themes/).

Choose from the official Blue, Cyan, Green, Magenta, Orange, Red, and Violet flavors.


Solarized-DarkArk - as hue inspired by Ethan Schoonover - is the highly valued color scheme for code editors and terminal emulators. Delivering GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell dark-mode-schemes, this GUI-centric theme strictly adheres to Ethan Schoonover's original color scheme, which has been published for many major applications, with some including the scheme pre-installed. Coders and GUI users, alike, know that - once you try Solarized-DarkArc - it is hard to go back to anything else.

In His Own Words:

"Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed for use with terminal and gui applications. It has several unique properties. I designed this colorscheme with both precise CIELAB lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships. It has been tested extensively in real world use on color calibrated displays (as well as uncalibrated/intentionally miscalibrated displays) and in a variety of lighting conditions." https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/

The GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell theme represents a careful blending of Arc, and other well-trusted elements, with an overlay of the original standard Solarized-Dark theming created by Ethan Schoonover.


Manual Installation Is Easy:

1) Extract the ".tar" or ".zip" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use GNOME Tweaks, Dconf Editor, or an equivalent 'Look & Feel'/configuration app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
