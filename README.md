A GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell - Dark Mode Theme - Plata is a new Gtk+ theme based on the latest Material Design refresh.

Ultimate-Plata-Dark mixes indigo, and shades of gray with bits of red, royal-blue, and violet. Ultimate-Plata-Dark supports Gtk+ 4x, 3x, as well as Gtk+ 2, and a multitude of desktop environments like Gnome Shell (and Flashback), Xfce, Mate, and LXDE, with Cinnamon coming soon. The original Plata theme designer (who also created Adapta theme) too offers theming support for Firefox (via FirefoxColor test pilot), Gedit, Plank dock, Telegram, and TweetDeck. Geany text editor theme is provided now provided in a separately installed theme right here.

The GTK, xfwm4, openbox-3, and GNOME-Shell theme represents a careful blending of Material Design refresh elements, with an overlay of the precise Plata theming hues.

Every element of this well-embraced theme package was re-built from the ground up, via this current 2.0 version, to address any issues which have arisen over the lifetime of the theme. Chiefly, the Budgie radio-button/check-box issues have been wholly resolved in the Material format. We are glad to hear UPD has been performing well on most systems.

Manual Installation Is Easy:

For themes: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.themes/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/themes/" folder - for the theme to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable it for your desktop.

If installing manually, make sure to install the dependency: "Murrine theme engine" if you do not already have it; and update your GTK+packages if you have not.

For icons: 1) Extract the "tar.xz" file into your "~/.icons/" folder - to install for current user only - or into the "/usr/share/icons/" folder - for the icons and folders to be applied globally. 2) Use the GNOME Tweak Tool or an equivalent app to enable them for your desktop.

When installing the Geany text editor theme, put the unzipped file in your home directory at: ~/.config/geany/colorschemes (create the 'colorschemes' directory, to mimic previous directions, if it doesn't yet exist )

Logging out and then logging back in may be necessary on some operating systems to fully implement themes and icons.
